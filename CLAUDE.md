# Development Workflow - Kiro-Style Spec-Driven Development

## How Kiro Works

Kiro is an AI assistant that helps build features systematically through a structured spec-driven development process.

### Core Philosophy

Instead of jumping straight into code, Kiro guides development through three phases:

1. **Requirements** - What needs to be built
2. **Design** - How it will be built  
3. **Tasks** - Step-by-step implementation plan

This ensures every feature is well-planned before implementation begins.

## The Spec Structure

Each feature gets its own folder in `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/` containing:

- **`requirements.md`** - User stories and acceptance criteria
- **`design.md`** - Technical architecture and implementation approach
- **`tasks.md`** - Actionable coding checklist

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

1. Create initial requirements based on feature idea
2. Use user stories format: *"As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"*
3. Include acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
   - Example: *"WHEN user clicks submit THEN system SHALL validate all fields"*
4. Iterate until requirements are approved

### Phase 2: Design Documentation

1. Research and create comprehensive `design.md`
2. Cover architecture, components, data models, error handling, testing strategy
3. May include Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
4. Address all requirements from the previous phase
5. Iterate until design is approved

### Phase 3: Task Planning

1. Break down design into actionable coding tasks in `tasks.md`
2. Create numbered checklist items (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
3. Each task references specific requirements
4. Focus only on code implementation activities
5. Prioritize incremental, testable progress
6. Iterate until task list is approved

## Key Features

- **Iterative Approval** - Explicit approval required for each document before moving to next phase
- **Requirement Traceability** - Tasks link back to specific requirements
- **Incremental Development** - Tasks build on each other progressively
- **Code-Focused** - Tasks only include activities a coding agent can execute

## Task Execution

Once spec is complete, execute tasks by:

1. Opening the `tasks.md` file
2. Clicking "Start task" next to individual task items
3. Implement one task at a time, stopping for review between tasks

## Getting Started

To begin a new feature spec:
1. Describe your feature idea
2. I'll guide you through the three-phase process
3. For existing specs, I can help review, update any phase, or execute implementation tasks

## Pro-Forma Analytics Specific Guidelines

### Business Domain Context
- **Real Estate Investment Analysis** - Focus on investor decision-making workflows
- **Financial Modeling** - Emphasis on accuracy, validation, and risk assessment
- **Data-Driven Decisions** - Replace manual assumptions with statistical forecasting

### Architecture Constraints
- **Clean Architecture** - Maintain domain/application/infrastructure separation
- **TDD/BDD Testing** - All features must include comprehensive test coverage
- **Prophet + Monte Carlo** - Leverage existing forecasting and simulation infrastructure

### Feature Prioritization
1. **Financial Calculation Engine** (highest priority - missing core business logic)
2. **Investment Decision Framework** (high priority - complete user workflow)
3. **Visualization & Reporting** (medium priority - user experience)
4. **API & Integration** (lower priority - external access)

# Documentation Standards

## Writing Guidelines

When creating or updating documentation in this repository, adhere to the following standards:

### Professional Tone Requirements
- Maintain professional, technical language throughout all documentation
- Avoid emojis, exclamation marks, or overly casual expressions
- Use declarative statements rather than conversational tone
- Write for technical audiences with appropriate domain expertise

### MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Completely Exhaustive)
- Structure documentation to eliminate overlap between sections
- Ensure each topic is covered in exactly one authoritative location
- Organize content hierarchically with clear boundaries between topics
- Verify that all relevant aspects of a topic are addressed comprehensively

### Centralized Documentation Structure
- All documentation must reside in the `/docs` folder
- Use clear, descriptive filenames following the pattern: `TOPIC_NAME.md`
- Maintain a master index in `/docs/README.md` linking to all documentation
- Reference external documentation through standardized linking conventions

### Redundancy Elimination
- Consolidate duplicate information into single authoritative sources
- Use cross-references rather than repeating content across documents
- Maintain a single source of truth for each technical concept
- Review existing documentation before creating new files to prevent duplication

### Implementation Requirements
- Update documentation concurrently with code changes
- Include technical specifications, API references, and architectural decisions
- Provide clear examples and usage patterns where applicable
- Maintain version compatibility information and migration guides

# Collaborative Development Workflow

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

When working with domain experts and stakeholders, Claude Code should actively engage in iterative clarification to ensure accurate implementation. This collaborative approach prevents costly rework and ensures technical solutions align with business requirements.

### Best Practices for Clarifying Questions

**When to Ask Questions:**
- Complex business logic requires implementation
- Technical specifications have ambiguities or gaps
- Multiple interpretation paths exist for requirements
- Domain-specific knowledge is required
- Integration points between systems are unclear

**How to Structure Questions:**
- Be specific and technical rather than generic
- Reference concrete examples from the codebase or documentation
- Provide your current understanding for validation
- Ask multiple related questions in logical sequence
- Include technical implications of different approaches

**Documentation-First Approach:**
- Document answers immediately in appropriate codebase locations
- Update architectural decisions and specifications
- Maintain traceability between questions and implementation
- Create searchable knowledge base for future reference

### Example Workflow Pattern

```
1. Identify Ambiguity
   └── "I see parameter X, but need clarification on calculation Y"

2. Form Specific Questions  
   └── "Is the calculation: A × B ÷ C, or (A × B) ÷ (C + D)?"

3. Provide Current Understanding
   └── "My understanding is X, but this conflicts with Y"

4. Ask for Validation/Correction
   └── "Should I implement approach A or B?"

5. Document Answers Immediately
   └── Update relevant .md files in /docs folder

6. Confirm Understanding
   └── "Let me summarize to ensure alignment..."
```

### Documentation Update Workflow

**Immediate Documentation:**
- Technical clarifications → Architecture documentation
- Business logic clarifications → Process flow documentation
- Integration clarifications → API and interface documentation
- Implementation decisions → Technical decision logs

**Documentation Standards:**
- Use clear, technical language appropriate for developers
- Include code examples and implementation patterns
- Reference specific files, functions, and line numbers when applicable
- Maintain MECE structure with cross-references
- Update table of contents and indexes

### Iterative Refinement Process

**Clarification Loop:**
1. Ask specific technical questions
2. Receive domain expert answers
3. Document answers in codebase immediately
4. Confirm understanding with summary
5. Identify follow-up questions if needed
6. Repeat until complete clarity achieved

**Knowledge Capture:**
- Each clarification session should result in permanent documentation
- Technical decisions should be traceable to business requirements
- Implementation patterns should be documented for consistency
- Edge cases and special conditions should be explicitly documented

### Communication Guidelines

**Effective Question Patterns:**
- "My understanding is X, but I need clarification on Y"
- "Should the system handle scenario A by doing X or Y?"
- "When condition Z occurs, what is the expected behavior?"
- "Are there any edge cases for calculation X that I should consider?"

**Avoid:**
- Generic questions without technical context
- Yes/no questions that don't advance understanding
- Questions that could be answered by reading existing documentation
- Multiple unrelated topics in single question set

### Success Indicators

**Quality Metrics:**
- Technical implementation matches business requirements
- Edge cases are identified and handled appropriately
- Documentation accurately reflects implemented behavior
- Future developers can understand design decisions
- Domain experts can validate technical specifications

**Process Metrics:**
- Reduced rework due to misunderstood requirements
- Faster onboarding for new team members
- Consistent implementation patterns across features
- Comprehensive knowledge base for maintenance
