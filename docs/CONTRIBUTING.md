## üìù Development Workflow

### Code Style Guidelines

We follow these coding standards:

- **Python**: PEP 8 with Black formatting
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all functions
- **Docstrings**: Follow Google docstring format
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict
from datetime import date
from decimal import Decimal


def calculate_irr(cash_flows: List[Dict[str, float]], 
                  precision: int = 4) -> Optional[float]:
    """
    Calculate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for a series of cash flows.
    
    Args:
        cash_flows: List of dictionaries containing cash flow data.
                   Each dict should have 'amount' and 'date' keys.
        precision: Number of decimal places for IRR calculation.
    
    Returns:
        IRR as a decimal, or None if calculation fails.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If cash flows are invalid.
    
    Example:
        >>> cash_flows = [
        ...     {'amount': -1000000, 'date': '2024-01-01'},
        ...     {'amount': 500000, 'date': '2025-01-01'}
        ... ]
        >>> calculate_irr(cash_flows)
        0.5
    """
    if not cash_flows:
        raise ValueError("Cash flows cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for all new functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names

```python
# tests/test_financial_calculations.py
import pytest
from decimal import Decimal
from src.core.calculations import calculate_irr


class TestIRRCalculation:
    """Test cases for IRR calculation functionality."""
    
    def test_irr_with_positive_cash_flows(self):
        """Test IRR calculation with positive cash flows."""
        cash_flows = [
            {'amount': -1000000, 'date': '2024-01-01'},
            {'amount': 500000, 'date': '2025-01-01'},
            {'amount': 600000, 'date': '2026-01-01'}
        ]
        
        result = calculate_irr(cash_flows)
        
        assert result is not None
        assert 0.1 < result < 0.3  # Reasonable IRR range
    
    def test_irr_with_empty_cash_flows(self):
        """Test IRR calculation with empty cash flows."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cash flows cannot be empty"):
            calculate_irr([])
    
    def test_irr_with_invalid_data(self):
        """Test IRR calculation with invalid data."""
        cash_flows = [{'amount': 'invalid', 'date': '2024-01-01'}]
        
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            calculate_irr(cash_flows)
```
