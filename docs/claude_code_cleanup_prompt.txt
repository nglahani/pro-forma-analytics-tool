You are a world-class solutions architect and software engineer. We have built an MVP in a monorepo (Python FastAPI backend and Next.js/React TypeScript frontend). Now perform a comprehensive retrospective audit and cleanup of the entire codebase to ensure it’s clean, robust, and ready for Phase 2 development. Focus on the following areas (including but not limited to):

1. Testing: Verify that all tests (e.g. in the tests/ folder) are well-organized and thorough, meeting our coverage goals (≈85% backend, 80% frontend). Ensure tests are easy to run and all pass successfully. This includes unit tests, integration tests, BDD tests (pytest-bdd), and front-end tests (Jest/React Testing Library).

2. End-to-End Functionality: Make sure the entire user flow from front-end to back-end is fully debugged and working. The application should build and deploy in the development environment without errors. Fix any integration issues so that the front-end and back-end communicate properly (e.g. API routes, data flow) and the system works as intended from UI to database.

3. Documentation: Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and reflects the current codebase. This includes README files, developer setup instructions, code comments, and docstrings. Update or add documentation wherever the code has changed during development, so that anyone reading the docs sees accurate information.

4. Code & File Hygiene: Identify and remove or consolidate any excess or unused code, files, or configuration that are not needed for the MVP’s core functionality. Clean up any “dead code,” TODO comments, or outdated documentation. The goal is to streamline the repository—especially important in a monorepo—so that only relevant, necessary components remain, making the structure clear.

5. Code Quality and Standards: Check that the codebase adheres to all our coding standards and quality checks. Make sure code formatting (Black with 88-char line length) and import ordering (isort) have been applied consistently. Lint the code (flake8 for Python, ESLint for TypeScript) and fix any issues to satisfy PEP8 and style rules. Verify strict type checking is clean (MyPy shows no type errors, TypeScript passes with strict mode). Run security scans (Bandit) and address any vulnerabilities or warnings. Ensure Python docstrings follow style guidelines (pydocstyle) and that any other pre-commit hooks (YAML/JSON/TOML validators, merge-conflict checks, large file checks) are all passing.

6. Architecture & Maintainability: Evaluate the overall project structure and maintainability. Since this is a monorepo, confirm that backend and frontend parts are properly separated and organized (for example, no unnecessary overlap or dependency issues between them). Simplify or refactor any convoluted areas of code to align with best practices. The codebase should have a clear architecture without “dead ends” or highly coupled components, making it easy to extend in Phase 2.

Approach this task systematically and thoroughly. Begin by identifying any problem areas or things that need fixing, then address them one by one. Focus on improving and consolidating the existing codebase rather than adding new code, unless a change is necessary to meet the above goals. In the end, we should have a clean, well-organized repository with all tests and quality checks passing – a solid foundation on which to build the next phase of the project.
