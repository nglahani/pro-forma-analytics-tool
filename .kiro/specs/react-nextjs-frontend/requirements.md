**US-5: Batch Property Analysis**
- **As a** real estate investor
- **I want to** compare multiple properties side-by-side
- **So that** I can prioritize investment opportunities efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user adds multiple properties THEN system SHALL process them asynchronously
- WHEN batch analysis completes THEN system SHALL display comparison table
- WHEN user views comparison THEN system SHALL sort by key metrics (NPV, IRR)
- WHEN user selects properties THEN system SHALL highlight recommended investments

### Secondary User: Portfolio Manager

**US-6: Market Data Integration**
- **As a** portfolio manager
- **I want to** access current market data and forecasts
- **So that** I can validate analysis assumptions against market conditions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user requests market data THEN system SHALL fetch data for selected MSA
- WHEN market data loads THEN system SHALL display key indicators (cap rates, interest rates)
- WHEN forecasts are available THEN system SHALL show Prophet-generated projections
- WHEN data is outdated THEN system SHALL display warning indicators
