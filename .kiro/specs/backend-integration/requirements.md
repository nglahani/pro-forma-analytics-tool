- ✅ WHEN user accesses property input page THEN system SHALL display form with all required fields
- ✅ WHEN user enters property data THEN system SHALL validate inputs in real-time
- ✅ WHEN user submits valid property data THEN system SHALL send data to backend API
- ✅ WHEN API returns success THEN system SHALL navigate to analysis results page
- ✅ WHEN API returns error THEN system SHALL display specific error message

**Implementation Details:**
- **Component**: `PropertyInputForm.tsx` - 6-step multi-step form with template system
- **Validation**: `AddressValidator.tsx` - Real-time address validation with MSA auto-detection
- **Market Integration**: `MarketDefaultsPanel.tsx` - Automatic market data defaults
- **Testing**: ✅ Validated with NYC property example, full form-to-API workflow

#### US-1.2: DCF Analysis Results Display ✅ **COMPLETED**
**As a user**, I want to view detailed DCF analysis results, so that I can understand the property's financial performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:** ✅ **ALL SATISFIED**
- ✅ WHEN DCF analysis completes THEN system SHALL display NPV, IRR, and equity multiple
- ✅ WHEN results are displayed THEN system SHALL show investment recommendation (STRONG_BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL, STRONG_SELL)
- ✅ WHEN user views results THEN system SHALL display cash flow projections for 6 years
- ✅ WHEN results load THEN system SHALL show terminal value and total return calculations

**Implementation Details:**
- **Component**: `DCFResultsDashboard.tsx` - Comprehensive results dashboard
- **Metrics**: NPV ($15.4M), IRR (54.5%), Equity Multiple (6.64x), Payback Period (4.0 years)
- **Recommendations**: Color-coded investment recommendations with risk assessment
- **Cash Flows**: Interactive 5-year cash flow progression with waterfall distributions
- **Testing**: ✅ Validated with real backend API integration, 44ms response time

### Epic 2: Monte Carlo Risk Analysis
**As a real estate investor**, I want to run Monte Carlo simulations on my properties, so that I can understand investment risks and potential outcomes.

#### US-2.1: Monte Carlo Simulation Execution
**As a user**, I want to initiate Monte Carlo analysis from property results, so that I can assess investment risk.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user clicks "Run Monte Carlo" THEN system SHALL prompt for scenario count (default 1000)
- WHEN simulation starts THEN system SHALL display progress indicator
- WHEN simulation completes THEN system SHALL display risk metrics and percentiles
- WHEN error occurs THEN system SHALL display retry option with error details

#### US-2.2: Risk Visualization
**As a user**, I want to view Monte Carlo results in charts and tables, so that I can understand probability distributions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN Monte Carlo completes THEN system SHALL display NPV and IRR percentiles (P5, P25, P50, P75, P95)
- WHEN results are shown THEN system SHALL display scenario classification (Bull/Bear/Neutral)
- WHEN viewing risk data THEN system SHALL show Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall
- WHEN charts load THEN system SHALL display probability distribution histograms

### Epic 3: Market Data Integration
**As a real estate analyst**, I want to view current and historical market data, so that I can make informed assumptions about market conditions.

#### US-3.1: Market Data Fetching
**As a user**, I want to view market data for supported MSAs, so that I can understand local market conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user selects MSA THEN system SHALL fetch current market parameters
- WHEN data loads THEN system SHALL display interest rates, cap rates, vacancy rates
- WHEN historical data requested THEN system SHALL show trends over time
- WHEN forecast available THEN system SHALL display Prophet predictions with confidence intervals

#### US-3.2: Market Data Visualization
**As a user**, I want to see market data in charts, so that I can identify trends and patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN market data loads THEN system SHALL display time series charts
- WHEN viewing trends THEN system SHALL show moving averages and trend lines
- WHEN forecast displayed THEN system SHALL show confidence bands
- WHEN data is stale THEN system SHALL show last updated timestamp

### Epic 4: Portfolio Management (REMOVED FROM MVP)
**Status**: Removed from MVP scope - Will be implemented as downstream feature

**Rationale**: Portfolio management features including batch processing and export functionality have been identified as non-essential for the initial MVP. These features will be developed in a future phase after core property analysis capabilities are fully established.

#### User Stories (Deferred)
- **US-4.1**: Batch Property Analysis - Deferred to future release
- **US-4.2**: Results Export - Deferred to future release

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- DCF analysis SHALL complete within 3 seconds for single property
- Monte Carlo simulation (1000 scenarios) SHALL complete within 10 seconds  
- Market data fetching SHALL complete within 2 seconds
- ~~Batch analysis SHALL process up to 50 properties concurrently~~ (Removed from MVP)

### Usability Requirements
- All forms SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
- Loading states SHALL be displayed for operations > 500ms
- Error messages SHALL be specific and actionable
- UI SHALL remain responsive during background processing

### Reliability Requirements
- System SHALL handle API timeouts gracefully with retry logic
- Invalid data SHALL not crash the application
- Network failures SHALL display appropriate fallback content
- Session expiration SHALL redirect to login with return path

### Security Requirements
- All API calls SHALL include user authentication headers
- Sensitive data SHALL not be logged in browser console
- API keys SHALL be stored securely and not exposed in client code
- User input SHALL be sanitized before API transmission

## Technical Constraints
- Must use existing FastAPI backend endpoints
- Must maintain existing UI/UX design patterns
- Must support existing authentication system
- Must be compatible with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Must work with current database schema (SQLite)

## Success Criteria
- Users can complete end-to-end property analysis workflow
- Monte Carlo simulations provide accurate risk assessment
- Market data displays current and historical trends
- ~~Batch processing handles multiple properties efficiently~~ (Removed from MVP)
- ~~Export functionality generates professional reports~~ (Removed from MVP)
- All user stories pass acceptance testing (excluding Epic 4)
- Performance benchmarks are met
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
