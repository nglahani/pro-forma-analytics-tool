# OneDrive Compatibility Solution - Requirements

**Feature**: Eliminate OneDrive file locking conflicts in development environment
**Priority**: Critical (blocking development workflow)
**Target Completion**: Immediate (current blocker)

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** developer working in a OneDrive-synced directory  
**I want** to run the Next.js development server without EBUSY file locking errors  
**So that** I can develop the frontend application reliably and efficiently

### Secondary User Story  
**As a** potential contributor to the codebase  
**I want** to easily clone and run the project on any development environment  
**So that** I can contribute without complex setup procedures

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

### AC1: Development Server Reliability
**WHEN** the Next.js development server is started in a OneDrive-synced directory  
**THEN** the system SHALL start successfully without EBUSY file locking errors  
**AND** the system SHALL serve HTTP 200 responses consistently  
**AND** the system SHALL support hot reload functionality without file conflicts

### AC2: Build Artifact Isolation  
**WHEN** Next.js generates build artifacts during development  
**THEN** the system SHALL store build files outside the OneDrive sync scope  
**AND** the system SHALL maintain proper module resolution for React components  
**AND** the system SHALL not generate any OneDrive sync conflicts

### AC3: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**WHEN** another developer clones the repository  
**THEN** the system SHALL work identically on OneDrive and non-OneDrive environments  
**AND** the system SHALL require no manual OneDrive-specific configuration  
**AND** the system SHALL maintain all development features (debugging, hot reload, etc.)

### AC4: Repository Portability
**WHEN** the repository is moved outside the OneDrive directory  
**THEN** the system SHALL work without any configuration changes  
**AND** the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality  
**AND** the system SHALL preserve all development workflow capabilities

## Business Requirements

### BR1: Zero File Locking Errors
- No EBUSY errors during development server operation
- No OneDrive sync conflicts with build artifacts
- Reliable file watching for hot reload functionality

### BR2: Development Experience Preservation  
- Maintain sub-3-second hot reload times
- Preserve Next.js debugging capabilities
- Keep all existing development features functional

### BR3: Easy Collaboration Setup
- Single-command setup for new contributors
- No manual OneDrive configuration required
- Consistent behavior across different Windows environments

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: File System Isolation
- Build artifacts must be outside OneDrive sync scope
- Source code can remain in OneDrive (for backup/sync benefits)
- No temporary files in OneDrive-monitored directories

### TR2: Module Resolution Integrity
- React/Next.js imports must resolve correctly
- TypeScript compilation must work without path issues
- Node.js module resolution must be maintained

### TR3: Development Server Stability
- HTTP server must start consistently
- WebSocket connections for hot reload must be stable
- No intermittent 500 errors or connection failures

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Development server startup: < 5 seconds (current: ~3 seconds)
- Hot reload time: < 3 seconds (maintain current performance)
- Build artifact generation: No performance regression

### NFR2: Reliability  
- 100% success rate for development server startup
- Zero OneDrive-related errors during development
- Consistent behavior across Windows 10/11 OneDrive versions

### NFR3: Maintainability
- Solution must be documented in codebase
- Configuration should be version-controlled
- No developer-specific manual steps required

## Constraints

### C1: Environment Constraints
- Primary development environment: Windows with OneDrive Personal
- OneDrive sync must remain functional for source code backup
- Solution must work on fresh Windows installations

### C2: Technology Constraints  
- Must maintain Next.js 15.5.2 compatibility
- Must preserve existing TypeScript configuration
- Must maintain current dependency structure

### C3: Repository Constraints
- Repository can be moved outside OneDrive if needed
- Solution must be easily cloneable by future contributors
- No breaking changes to existing development commands

## Out of Scope

### OOS1: Production Environment Changes
- No changes to production build or deployment processes
- No modifications to existing Docker production containers
- No changes to CI/CD pipeline configuration

### OOS2: OneDrive Configuration Changes
- No modifications to global OneDrive settings
- No OneDrive application-level configuration changes
- No OneDrive exclusion rules that affect other projects

### OOS3: Alternative Development Servers
- No migration away from Next.js development server
- No replacement of webpack with alternative bundlers
- No fundamental changes to frontend technology stack

## Assumptions

### A1: Environment Assumptions
- Developer has administrative access to Windows machine
- OneDrive Personal version is being used (not Business)
- Developer can create directories outside OneDrive scope

### A2: Technical Assumptions  
- Current Next.js configuration is otherwise functional
- Backend (FastAPI) development server is working correctly
- Node.js and npm installations are functional

### A3: Workflow Assumptions
- Developer preference is for local development (not cloud-based)
- Hot reload and debugging features are essential for productivity
- Multiple browser testing is required during development

## Success Metrics

### SM1: Error Elimination
- Zero EBUSY file locking errors in development server logs
- Zero OneDrive sync conflict notifications during development
- 100% success rate for `npm run dev` command execution

### SM2: Performance Maintenance  
- Development server startup time ≤ current baseline (~3 seconds)
- Hot reload response time ≤ current baseline (~2 seconds)
- Build artifact generation time ≤ current baseline

### SM3: Developer Experience
- Single command setup for new environment (`git clone` + `npm install` + `npm run dev`)
- No manual configuration steps in setup documentation
- Identical behavior in OneDrive vs non-OneDrive environments

## Open Questions

### Q1: Repository Location Strategy
**Question**: Should we recommend moving the entire repository outside OneDrive, or implement a hybrid approach with source in OneDrive but builds outside?
**Impact**: Affects backup/sync strategy and collaboration workflow
**Decision needed by**: Before design phase

### Q2: Docker Development Environment  
**Question**: Should we create a Docker development container for the frontend to completely isolate from OneDrive?
**Impact**: Changes developer workflow but provides maximum isolation
**Decision needed by**: Before design phase  

### Q3: Build Directory Strategy
**Question**: Should build artifacts go to a fixed system location (e.g., `C:\temp`) or a user-specific location (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local`)?
**Impact**: Affects permission requirements and cleanup procedures
**Decision needed by**: Before implementation
