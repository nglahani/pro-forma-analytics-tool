# OneDrive Compatibility Solution - Implementation Tasks

**Implementation Strategy**: Docker Compose-based development environment  
**Estimated Total Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Risk Level**: Medium (repository migration + containerization)

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Repository Migration (30 minutes)

#### Task 1.1: Prepare Target Environment
- [ ] Create target directory: `C:\Development\pro-forma-analytics-tool`
- [ ] Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
- [ ] Stop all current development servers (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Verify sufficient disk space for repository duplication

**Exit Criteria**: Clean target directory ready, Docker available, services stopped

#### Task 1.2: Migrate Repository
- [ ] Copy entire repository: `xcopy /E /I /H` from OneDrive location to `C:\Development`
- [ ] Verify all files copied correctly (check file count and sizes)
- [ ] Update git working directory: `cd C:\Development\pro-forma-analytics-tool`
- [ ] Test git status and remote connectivity

**Exit Criteria**: Complete repository in new location, git functional

#### Task 1.3: Validate Migration
- [ ] Verify backend still works natively: `python -m uvicorn src.presentation.api.main:app --reload`
- [ ] Confirm database files accessible
- [ ] Test that OneDrive no longer monitors the repository
- [ ] Document original OneDrive location for potential rollback

**Exit Criteria**: Native environment functional in new location

### Phase 2: Docker Development Environment (90 minutes)

#### Task 2.1: Create Frontend Development Container
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile.frontend.dev` with Node.js 18-alpine base
- [ ] Configure working directory and dependency installation
- [ ] Set up development command with hot reload
- [ ] Add health check endpoint configuration

**Exit Criteria**: Frontend Dockerfile builds successfully

#### Task 2.2: Adapt Backend Development Container  
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile.backend.dev` based on existing `Dockerfile.test`
- [ ] Configure development-specific command with uvicorn --reload
- [ ] Set up proper volume mount points for source code
- [ ] Add curl for health checks

**Exit Criteria**: Backend Dockerfile builds successfully

#### Task 2.3: Create Docker Compose Configuration
- [ ] Create `docker-compose.dev.yml` with frontend and backend services
- [ ] Configure volume mounts: source code (cached), node_modules (anonymous)
- [ ] Set up port mappings: 3000 (frontend), 8000 (backend)
- [ ] Configure environment variables for development
- [ ] Add health checks for both services
- [ ] Create custom network for service communication

**Exit Criteria**: Docker Compose configuration complete

#### Task 2.4: Build and Test Images
- [ ] Build frontend image: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build frontend`
- [ ] Build backend image: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build backend`  
- [ ] Test individual container functionality
- [ ] Verify volume mounts work correctly

**Exit Criteria**: Both images build and run individually

### Phase 3: Service Integration (45 minutes)

#### Task 3.1: Test Full Stack Startup
- [ ] Start complete environment: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
- [ ] Verify frontend accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Verify backend accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
- [ ] Test inter-service communication (frontend → backend API calls)

**Exit Criteria**: Full stack runs without errors

#### Task 3.2: Validate Hot Reload Functionality
- [ ] Test frontend hot reload: Modify React component and verify browser updates
- [ ] Test backend hot reload: Modify Python code and verify service restarts
- [ ] Measure hot reload performance vs native environment
- [ ] Verify no EBUSY errors in container logs

**Exit Criteria**: Hot reload working for both services

#### Task 3.3: Test Database Persistence
- [ ] Verify SQLite databases accessible from backend container
- [ ] Test data persistence across container restarts
- [ ] Validate database file permissions and accessibility
- [ ] Confirm demo workflow still functions

**Exit Criteria**: Database operations functional in containers

### Phase 4: Development Workflow (30 minutes)

#### Task 4.1: Create Developer Scripts
- [ ] Create `scripts/dev-setup.bat` for Windows quick setup
- [ ] Create `scripts/dev-setup.sh` for cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Add container management commands (start, stop, logs, rebuild)
- [ ] Create migration helper script for other developers

**Exit Criteria**: One-command development environment setup

#### Task 4.2: IDE Integration Configuration
- [ ] Test VS Code Remote-Containers extension compatibility
- [ ] Configure debugging for containerized applications
- [ ] Verify TypeScript/ESLint work correctly with volume mounts
- [ ] Test port forwarding for development tools

**Exit Criteria**: IDE integration functional

### Phase 5: Documentation and Validation (45 minutes)

#### Task 5.1: Update Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with Docker-first development instructions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common Docker issues
- [ ] Document migration process for future developers
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new development workflow

**Exit Criteria**: Complete documentation for new workflow

#### Task 5.2: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Full end-to-end workflow test: property input → DCF analysis
- [ ] Performance comparison: container vs native startup times
- [ ] Cross-platform testing: Verify setup works on different Windows versions
- [ ] Load testing: Multiple concurrent requests to both services

**Exit Criteria**: All functionality working, performance acceptable

#### Task 5.3: Cleanup and Finalization
- [ ] Remove temporary files from migration
- [ ] Clean up unused Docker images and volumes
- [ ] Create backup of original OneDrive location (if needed)
- [ ] Update .gitignore for any new container-related files

**Exit Criteria**: Clean, production-ready development environment

### Phase 6: Rollback Preparation (15 minutes)

#### Task 6.1: Document Rollback Process
- [ ] Create step-by-step rollback instructions
- [ ] Identify rollback triggers (when to abandon containerization)
- [ ] Test partial rollback (one service containerized, one native)
- [ ] Document hybrid development approaches

**Exit Criteria**: Clear rollback strategy available

- **Task 2.3 (Docker Compose Setup)**: Risk of complex configuration errors
  - *Mitigation*: Incremental testing, start with minimal configuration
- **Task 3.2 (Hot Reload)**: Risk of performance degradation
