# API Layer Enhancements - Requirements

## Feature Overview
Enhance the existing production-ready API layer with high-impact, low-effort improvements focused on developer experience, performance, and error handling.

## User Stories

### Enhanced OpenAPI Documentation
**As a** developer integrating with the Pro-Forma Analytics API  
**I want** comprehensive, interactive documentation with examples  
**So that** I can quickly understand and implement API endpoints without trial-and-error

**As a** frontend developer building a real estate dashboard  
**I want** clear request/response examples for all endpoints  
**So that** I can build robust UI components that handle all API scenarios

**As a** QA engineer testing the API  
**I want** documented error scenarios and response formats  
**So that** I can create comprehensive test cases

### Response Caching
**As a** user of the DCF analysis API  
**I want** frequently requested market data to load instantly  
**So that** I can perform rapid analysis without waiting for repeated calculations

**As a** system administrator monitoring API performance  
**I want** reduced database load for repeated market data queries  
**So that** the system can handle higher concurrent usage

### Enhanced Error Responses
**As a** developer debugging API integration issues  
**I want** detailed error messages with actionable suggestions  
**So that** I can quickly identify and fix integration problems

**As a** user experiencing API errors  
**I want** clear, informative error messages  
**So that** I understand what went wrong and how to fix it

## Acceptance Criteria

### Enhanced OpenAPI Documentation
**WHEN** developer visits `/api/v1/docs`  
**THEN** system SHALL display comprehensive documentation including:
- Detailed endpoint descriptions with business context
- Complete request/response examples for each endpoint
- Error response documentation with example error objects
- Authentication examples showing proper API key usage
- Interactive examples that can be executed directly

**WHEN** developer views endpoint documentation  
**THEN** system SHALL provide:
- Clear parameter descriptions with business meaning
- Example property data objects with realistic values
- Expected response structures with field explanations
- Common error scenarios and troubleshooting tips

### Response Caching
**WHEN** client requests market data that was requested within last 15 minutes  
**THEN** system SHALL return cached response within 50ms

**WHEN** client requests forecast data that was requested within last 30 minutes  
**THEN** system SHALL return cached response within 50ms

**WHEN** cached data exists for system configuration endpoint  
**THEN** system SHALL return cached response within 10ms

**WHEN** cache expires or is invalidated  
**THEN** system SHALL fetch fresh data and update cache automatically

### Enhanced Error Responses
**WHEN** API returns 400-level error  
**THEN** system SHALL include:
- Specific error code for programmatic handling
- Human-readable error message
- Suggested corrective actions
- Links to relevant documentation
- Request correlation ID for debugging

**WHEN** API returns 500-level error  
**THEN** system SHALL include:
- Generic error message (no sensitive details)
- Request correlation ID
- Timestamp for log correlation
- Suggested retry behavior

**WHEN** validation error occurs  
**THEN** system SHALL include:
- Field-specific error messages
- Examples of valid input formats
- Complete list of validation failures

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API contracts
- Changes must not affect response times by more than 50ms for uncached requests
- Must work with existing authentication and rate limiting middleware
- Cache implementation must be memory-efficient (< 100MB for typical usage)
- All enhancements must pass existing integration tests

## Success Metrics
- Developer documentation satisfaction: Clear examples reduce integration time
- API response times: 90%+ of repeated requests served from cache within 50ms
- Error resolution time: Enhanced error messages reduce support requests
- System performance: No degradation in cold request response times

## Out of Scope
- Database-level caching (Redis, external cache servers)
- Authentication system changes
- New endpoint development
- Breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Real-time WebSocket features
- Advanced monitoring/metrics collection
