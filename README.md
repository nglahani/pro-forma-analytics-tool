A production-ready real estate DCF analysis platform that transforms traditional Excel-based pro formas into sophisticated financial models using time series forecasting and Monte Carlo simulations.

## Introduction

Traditional real estate financial analysis relies on static Excel spreadsheets with fixed assumptions that fail to capture market volatility and uncertainty. This tool revolutionizes multifamily real estate investment analysis by replacing static assumptions with dynamic, data-driven forecasting that provides investors with probability-based financial projections and risk-adjusted investment recommendations.

The platform integrates advanced machine learning forecasting with Monte Carlo simulation to generate hundreds of market scenarios, enabling investors to understand the full range of potential outcomes rather than relying on single-point estimates. This approach provides critical insights into downside risk, upside potential, and optimal investment timing that traditional pro formas cannot capture.

By leveraging historical market data and proven forecasting methodologies, investors can make more informed decisions, better understand their risk exposure, and identify opportunities that static analysis would miss. The result is a comprehensive investment analysis framework that bridges the gap between academic financial theory and practical real estate investment decision-making.

## Architecture (Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design)

This project implements **Clean Architecture** with **Domain-Driven Design** principles, ensuring maintainable, testable, and scalable code:

### Architectural Principles Implemented:
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear business purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modifying existing code
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces rather than large ones
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain entities with business rule enforcement
- **Immutable Entities**: All domain objects are immutable for thread safety
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Business rule validation at entity boundaries

## Features (v1.5 Production Ready with REST API - Enhanced Technical Foundation)

### Complete DCF Engine with Clean Architecture
- **4-Phase Workflow**: DCF Assumptions → Initial Numbers → Cash Flow Projections → Financial Metrics
- **Investment Recommendations**: 5-tier system (STRONG_BUY to STRONG_SELL) with comprehensive risk assessment
- **Terminal Value Modeling**: Exit scenarios with cap rate analysis and debt payoff calculations
- **Waterfall Distribution Modeling**: Sophisticated investor/operator equity distribution calculations
- **Performance Optimization**: IRR calculations under 0.01ms with memory-efficient processing
- **Production-Grade Validation**: 2,174+ historical data points with comprehensive statistical validation

### Pro Forma Parameters
1. **Interest Rates**: Treasury 10Y, Commercial Mortgage, Fed Funds
2. **Market Metrics**: Cap Rate, Vacancy Rate
3. **Growth Metrics**: Rent Growth, Expense Growth, Property Growth
4. **Lending Requirements**: LTV Ratio, Closing Costs, Lender Reserves

### Prophet Forecasting Engine

Meta's Prophet is a time series forecasting model designed for business forecasting with seasonal effects and holiday impacts. For real estate analysis, Prophet provides several critical advantages:

- **Trend Detection**: Automatically identifies long-term market trends in rental rates, vacancy, and property values
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Captures annual cycles in real estate markets (e.g., stronger leasing seasons)
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence intervals around forecasts, enabling risk assessment
- **Missing Data Handling**: Robust performance even with incomplete historical data
- **Non-linear Growth**: Models market inflection points and changing growth rates

The tool applies Prophet forecasting to 11 key pro forma parameters, generating 6-year projections that feed directly into the DCF analysis. This approach replaces static market assumptions with dynamic forecasts that reflect actual market behavior and trends.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

Rather than relying on single-point estimates from forecasting models, the tool generates 500+ probabilistic scenarios using Monte Carlo simulation. This approach provides critical advantages over point estimates:

- **Risk Quantification**: Understand the full range of potential outcomes, from best-case to worst-case scenarios
- **Correlation Modeling**: Captures relationships between market variables (e.g., interest rates affecting cap rates)
- **Stress Testing**: Evaluates investment performance under extreme market conditions
- **Probability-Based Decisions**: Provides likelihood estimates for achieving target returns
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Enables comparison of risk-adjusted returns across multiple investments

Each simulation incorporates economic correlations between variables, ensuring realistic scenario generation that reflects how markets actually behave during different economic cycles.

### Monte Carlo Integration
- **500+ Scenario Generation** with economic correlations
- **Market Classification** (Bull, Bear, Neutral, Growth, Stress)
- **Risk & Growth Scoring** with composite metrics
- **Statistical Validation**: Quality checks for scenario realism

### Production-Ready REST API Layer
- **8 Core Endpoints**: Complete API coverage for DCF analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and data access
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication with development and production modes
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm with customizable request limits (configurable requests/minute)
- **Request Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging with correlation IDs for debugging
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with detailed error codes and actionable suggestions
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic model validation with field-level error messages
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing for web application integration
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Auto-generated Swagger documentation at `/api/v1/docs`
- **Async Processing**: Concurrent batch analysis with semaphore-controlled concurrency
- **Health Monitoring**: Database connectivity monitoring and system status reporting

### Python Services (Direct Integration)

The tool provides a complete 4-phase DCF workflow accessible through Python services. To run a complete analysis, instantiate the required services and process your property through each phase. The demo workflow in `demo_end_to_end_workflow.py` provides a working example that processes a sample property through all phases, generating NPV, IRR calculations, and investment recommendations. For detailed implementation examples, refer to the test files in `tests/integration/` which demonstrate various property configurations and market scenarios.

### Complete DCF Workflow (Production-Ready v1.3)

financial_metrics = financial_metrics_service.calculate_financial_metrics(
    cash_flow_projection, dcf_assumptions, initial_numbers, discount_rate=0.10
)

# Results with production-grade validation
print(f"NPV: ${financial_metrics.net_present_value:,.0f}")
print(f"IRR: {financial_metrics.internal_rate_return:.1%}")
print(f"Equity Multiple: {financial_metrics.equity_multiple:.2f}x")
